Subnet Calculator/Random I.P. address generator

This is a simple Subnet Calculator command line application. it takes users input in the form of an IP address and a Subnet mask. it then prints the network address and broadcast address for the network as well as the wildcard mask and mask bits. it also calculates the valid number of hosts available on the network and will generate a valid IP address within the network parameters if prompted.
